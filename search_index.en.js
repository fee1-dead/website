I'm the lead for Rust's const traits project group. We hope to stabilize const traits soon, but this is a complex feature with huge amounts of design considerations, and we keep getting the same comments from different people who probably have less familiarity with the feature and its design.\nThat's quite fair because I can't require everyone to have followed every discussion everywhere. I have followed loads of discussions, so this summarizes some of the counterarguments we've had so far.\nIf you're interested in the language design for how we plan to allow calling trait methods in const contexts, this should be a good complementary resource to the currently open RFC. You might disagree with parts of this post, though.\nCurrent proposal summary\nDeclare a trait as const so you can use it in trait bounds:\n\nMake impls const so we can satisfy those bounds:\n\nFor generic const code, a Destruct trait will be made available (not necessarily included in the first stabilization) to allow the type to be dropped at compile time:\n\nT: Destruct is true for all T, while T: ~const Destruct only holds if the compiler knows its destructor can be run in compile time. (See proposal 4 for more on this)\nMeaning of ~const\n\nWe use ~const throughout this document but it is feasible to switch this to any other compatible syntax (like [const] or (const)). In fact, the nightly Rust as of writing accepts both T: ~const Trait and T: [const] Trait. I'll stick to ~const for simplicity.\n\n~const is a modifier on trait bounds. (including super traits, e.g. \nconst trait A: ~const B {}) In general, they only need to be proven if you're using them from const contexts. Hence they're also called \"maybe-const\" or \"const-if-const\" bounds.\n~const bounds on a function are only enforced when you call it. This allows us to instantiate a function in const contexts even if we can't call it:\n\nBut note that constness isn't a generic parameter and shouldn't be considered instantiated for each call to a const fn:1 If you think about the function foo and pass in a T that does not implement const PartialEq, the constness of foo does not change due to the unsatisfied const predicate - const fn is \"always-const\" (and not \"maybe-const\") in a sense that it simply imposes additional constraints if called in const contexts.\n1: This particular wrong understanding (specifically, constness as a generic effect parameter which is then \"tied\" to the constness of the trait bounds) runs into a myriad of issues if you think down the line too hard. I have some thoughts about it but it will probably be in a different post.\n\nThe call above errors not because foo becomes non-const when T = MyType&lt;u8&gt; - it errors because MyType&lt;u8&gt;: const PartialEq isn't satisfied.\nWith the current proposal and model, we now explore a few alternatives that Rust team members have thought through, and I will explain why they can't really work.\nproposal 1: complicity in implicity\nWhy not make ~const the default and use an opt-out for non-const bounds?\nIt is expected that people will write ~const bounds a lot. What if we made T: Trait implicitly const-when-const if it's inside a const item? i.e. making the following work:\n\nUsers of non-const trait bounds in const fn will now use an opt-out syntax such as ?const:2\n2: note that the original LazyCell source code has the trait bound on the impl. This part is only for illustrating the opt-out bound so we don't get into the nitty gritty yet.\n\nWhy can't this work? The very first drawback this proposal faces is that these things are already possible on stable today:\n\nIf we ever wanted to allow impl Trait/dyn Trait/fn() to be callable in const contexts, then they should follow the same opt-out, necessitating the following change:\n\nThis then runs into multiple problems.\n1A: editioning everything\nWe already allow trait bounds that mean non-const in const fn. This means if we were to change T: Trait in const fn to what we currently mean by T: ~const Trait, we have to do it over an edition since it is a breaking change.\nBut of course we can't make these changes immediately. Suppose we're currently in the 2024 edition and we accept this plan to migrate everyone to use ?const where necessary. We can accept ?const in any edition as it is equivalent to T: Trait now. Now in 2026 edition we deprecate non-?const bounds, we emit a warning everytime someone writes T: Trait but means T: ?const Trait. In 2028 edition T: Trait now means T: ~const Trait (implicit behavior). We need to do this change over two editions because just doing it in one edition is even more problematic.\nSuppose FnOnce becomes a const trait. This poses issues for crates in edition 2024 or below, who have written this:\n\nIt is dangerous for crates having non-const bounds that never went through the intermediate 2026 edition to directly migrate to edition 2028, as edition migration processes primarily rely on things compilers can catch. There are things that cargo fix --edition can't catch, and there are people who upgrade editions by simply bumping the number and fixing the issues that arise with bumping (how can you fault them? I personally never thought editions could significantly change behavior and meaning of syntax).\nThis is a major meaning change (perhaps bigger than disjoint closure capture and if-let rescope which won't break/change too much) because there are tons of const fn with trait bounds that all currently mean non-const.3 Their migration path to a potential 2028 edition is very scary to me.\n3: See this search, and to a lesser extent, this search\n1B: non const traits and implicit bounds\n\nOn the outset, there appears to be three choices:\n\nCompile this, with T: NonConstTrait conditionally const\nCompile this, but T: NonConstTrait doesn't become conditionally const (not ~const NonConstTrait)\nMake this a compile error.\n\n#1 can't really work due to breaking change complications when methods change their bounds to ~const (see 2A),\n#2 can't work either because it would make it a breaking change for someone to change their trait into a const trait (the T: NonConstTrait becomes stricter if NonConstTrait betrays its name and becomes const)\nSo the only viable choice is #3. However, this has the ability to confuse many people, specifically with 1C and 1D.\n1C: impl confusion\nShould impl blocks also be a part of this elision? That is, should the following have a non-const T: Trait bound applied to foo but ~const bound applied to bar?\n\nIf yes, this can be super confusing. 1B will turn this into an error on bar if Trait is not a const trait. It's also a candidate for accidentally stricter bounds than necessary (when will users know when to use ?const? cc 1D)\nIf not, it can also be super confusing. The rules for when T: Trait implicitly means T: ~const Trait would be complicated, hard to teach, and slightly inconsistent, given that something like the following should have implicit ~const at the impl-level.\n\nAll of this is mostly because of the weird double meaning of T: Trait (on non-const contexts, equivalent to T: ?const Trait in const contexts, but ~const in const-contexts)\nAn explicit opt-in scheme, with ~const bounds at the impl level, if allowed, would not have the same issues, as it is clear what the user intended, and it is clear that it would apply to const fns.\n1D: usage path\nProposal 1 will make writing stricter bounds the default, as T: Trait in const fn is stricter than T: ?const Trait. It is only with non-const traits (1B) where a user will be prompted to use ?const.\nThis is a broad assumption that users will most of the times want ~const, similar to Sized vs. ?Sized, but probably less correct than the latter. There are many constructors with trait bounds (e.g. LazyLock with F: FnOnce) that don't need to call methods at compile time. They can be\nintended for storage (so the stored types' methods can later be called at runtime), or just using traits' associated consts.\nOn the other hand, ~const as opt-in would be required only when someone attempts to call a trait's methods (easily suggestable by compiler errors), which would leave people more naturally using T: Trait to mean non-const if they don't need ~const.\n1E: virality\nRemember the snippet at the beginning of this proposal which contained function pointers and dyn traits, and impl traits? Well.. about those.\nSuppose in the future we might want to allow dyn ~const Trait or ~const fn() pointers. Notwithstanding the potential complexity for the compiler to support these, but let's say struct A(pub ~const fn()) is possible, and it means that the field must be a function pointer callable at compile time if A is being constructed at compile time. dyn ~const Trait operates similarly.\nThis then means an implicit ~const version now has to either (1) affect all types containing fn() pointers and dyn Traits by making them imply ~const or (2) create an opt-in syntax specifically for these things.\n(1) is self-evidently problematic; (2) feels extremely inconsistent, why use opt-in in some places but opt-out in others?\nproposal 2: selectiveness\nWhy have const apply to the entire trait?\nThis has many layers to unwrap: why do we have to mark the trait at all? Can we have per-method choices? Can we do refinement with bounds on specific methods?\nWe'll answer these in this section, but we'll start with the most general fact: If we want impls to be const or non-const, there must be a way to distinguish a trait that allows const implementations and a trait that does not. And all current traits (before const traits stabilize) must not allow const implementations.\n2A: Which Gender Is Your Trait\nLet's look at Iterator::sum:\n\nFor any generic parameter T where T: ~const Iterator, we can't really call T::sum::&lt;usize&gt;. Right now the bound on S is S: Sum&lt;Self::Item&gt; but it should really be S: ~const Sum&lt;Self::Item&gt;. If we allowed calling T::sum::&lt;usize&gt;, and the bound later turns ~const, it would break if usize remains having a non-const Sum impl. So to avoid breaking changes we have two choices:\n\nAllow T: ~const Trait on non-const traits but can't call any of the methods\nDisallow T: ~const Trait on non-const traits.\n\nOur current design uses #2, as #1 feels quite counterintuitive: the idea of ~const bounds is to allow calling methods on them, so it isn't really useful. It would also prevent any actual uses of generic items with ~const bounds on non-const traits, as const impls cannot be written without the trait being const. With #2, we're able to give trait authors one chance to make sure their bounds are either non-const or ~const as they see fit. As once the trait is const, turning existing non-const bounds into ~const would be a breaking chnage.\nIn any case, the compiler must know what is a const trait and what is not.\n2B: the constness divide\nThe alternative here would be to allow ~const Tr bounds on Tr without it being marked a const trait, but not allow calls to methods until the methods are marked const in some way. (i.e. per-method constness)\n\nThis has its own caveats.\nFirst, this means there are never-const methods in a trait. Some methods allow callers in const contexts and require const implementations while some do not. I don't think that's really useful. If a user writes T: ~const Trait, they'd normally expect every method in Trait to now be const-callable. It's quite rare for a trait to be designed in a way that allows some methods to be callable in const contexts while others not. (at least, no one has ever provided a concrete example) Those use cases would be covered by separating them into two traits anyways.\nSecond, we still need a way to figure out whether a trait is const to decide whether to allow const impls. We can't allow const impls for non-const traits, to allow existing non-const traits to transition their methods into const.\nBut that means once A makes foo ~const and publishes a new crate version, they've lost their ability to make bar ~const in the future, as downstream crates would happily do this:\n\nThat is super awkward to both teach and learn. This awkwardness was even more extensively discussed in my HackMD doc from four months ago.\n2C: per-method bounds\nOkay, so, it's really awkward for fine-grained per-method constness to co-exist with whole-trait constness (necessary for trait bounds as well as whether to allow const impls). What if we dealt away with whole-trait constness entirely?\nConsider ~const bounds on methods. Some scheme like:\n\nWhere impls can't be wholly const or non-const, but individual methods can become const on their own:\n\nBut that proposal has a lot of downsides.\nBecause all methods' signatures are now lying to you. Consider the common case of some impl using a generic type's methods:\n\nin Option&lt;T&gt;::some_fun_method, we have no idea whether we can actually call T::some_fun_method, without writing a bound. Making this bound apply to the entire trait impl seems awful to require (defeats the entire point of an individual method being const and writing ~const bounds on individual methods), so then this per-method bound now applies to some_fun_method. That also means the requirements for a particular method to be const may be stricter than what is written on the trait method signature. (C::some_fun_method has no additional restrictions whereas &lt;Option&lt;T&gt; as C&gt;::some_fun_method does).\nThis is pretty much not avoidable, as traits upstream cannot know what methods downstream impls want to call (in this case, T is not even nameable at the upstream trait C)\nTherefore, all const fns that attempt to call some trait methods on a generic parameter must add a bound on that specific method.\nThis is particularly frustrating for Iterator, which has loads of extension methods (that can all be overriden to do something non-const, under this scheme), and bounds are necessary for all methods being called, resulting in the following for a function that should have been super simple:\n\nThis proposal might also need special annotations on trait methods that provide a const default method body but otherwise doesn't require downstream impls to be const (otherwise you wouldn't know which default method bodies are callable from const). That adds an additional layer of syntax complexity which needs to be designed.\nThere was also a bit of Zulip discussion on this. See this topic and its discussion, mainly before May 8th.\nproposal 3: isn't it just const?\nWhy not use T: const Trait for const-when-const bounds?\nThis is one of the proposals which actually has some merit. The idea is to use T: const Trait for the \"const-if-const\" syntax, while thinking about the future with const(always) or =const to represent always-const bounds.\nBecause it turns out we actually do need always-const bounds, for the trait bound to be used in an assoc const-item const A: () = ();, in a const block const { 1 + 2 }, or in const generic arguments [T; { 1 + 2 }]. Those could become usage sites that require a stricter bound than ~const, so we must think about reserving the \"always-const\" bound for them.\nMy main reservation with this proposal is that it sort of justifies a change of const items, const blocks into using the same new syntax for always-const bounds. so const(always) X: i32 = 42; and const(always) { 2 * 3 * 7 } instead of what we have now which reserves T: const Trait for always-const to keep the consistency. But we always have some form of (small, potentially acceptable) inconsistency one way or the other (such as ~const in const fn, see proposal 6), so it might end up being an option we end up choosing.\nproposal 4: destructive interference\nWhy Destruct? Why not just T: ~const Drop?\nWe are in a special place because some destructors are non-const. We already allow non-const impl Drop for MyTypes, so there needs to be a way to distinguish types that can be dropped in compile time from types that cannot.\nThis leads to us to a new marker trait called Destruct, which is automatically implemented. Non-const Destruct holds for all types, but const Destruct only holds if the type's Drop impl (if it exists) is const and the type's components all implement const Destruct.\nTherefore, you must sprinkle your functions with T: ~const Destruct bounds when you're constifying them, if generic parameters need to be dropped at any point in the function.\nWhy not T: ~const Drop? Well it makes a huge asymmetry with T: Drop bounds, as the latter would only hold if T has a manual Drop impl. It would also make T: const Drop not imply T: Drop, which has weird language-level implications as well as compiler-level implications. (we have run into trait bound cache issues with this in the past4)\n4: it might be fine to desugar T: ~const Drop into T: ~const Destruct while keeping Destruct hidden. I still don't think that's a good option because of the asymmetry.\nT: Drop is also a valid bound even though you might not have seen this. pin-project uses this bound to prevent any user from writing their own custom destructors on their types. So no matter what scheme we end up choosing, we must have at least two traits. One to represent the ability to be destructed, one to represent whether or not a type has a custom destructor. Otherwise we run into asymmetry between T: const Drop vs T: Drop.\nproposal 4.5: destructive interference, part 2\nCan we make T: ~const Destruct implicit?\nThis is hard to say, depending on what is meant by \"implicit\". Inferring whether requiring ~const Destruct for generic types based on whether the code has a possibility to drop the type is no-go, because changing the type signature/trait bounds based on the body has loads of bad semver complications and is generally not possible in the compiler architecture.\nMaking ~const Destruct implicit for all generic params is not good, either. Many generic API interfaces want to assume as little about their types as possible, so a broad scheme like this necessitates an opt-out syntax which seems too odd to have/hard to design.\nA more limited plan might be to infer a : ~const Destruct super trait if some methods on a trait take self by-value, that also has issues because the following example means shouldn't have const trait Add: ~const Destruct inferred:\n\nOne possible plan (will likely be our actual plan) is to lint const traits that take self by-value and recommend adding a ~const Destruct super trait. That way it will save crate users relying on that trait to not have to add ~const Destruct bounds everywhere, at the same time not assuming everyone wants this.\nproposal 5: academic zealotry\nLet's follow the approach used in academic paper X..\nThis section was adapted from a similar comment I made on Zulip in May.\nAcademic research is exciting work. Language design in Rust is different (maybe slightly boring?) because it's mostly a weighing of the pros and cons of every possible alternatives and finding ways to practically make the language more capable.\nThe work on const traits in Rust is often linked to work on effects in other (academic) programming languages, results published via research papers, etc.\nWe then often see an excitement to apply those academic thinking models to Rust.\nThose thinking models often appear super convoluted to me. It sometimes looks like practicality has been dismissed in favor of generality. That's fine, but I don't think they are very compatible with Rust.\nI think it would be fair to consider the role of formal modeling of effects as a different programming language and how programmers using that programming language model their functions and their ability to be called in different contexts. (i.e. runtime vs. compile time)\nThe academic way of thinking about effects/const traits holds the same amount of weight as some other programming language's way of thinking about effects/const traits to me. It's nice to try to incorporate the bits that would work for us, but incompatible things are incompatible. Forcing Rust's model to be losslessly transferable to a formal model is equivalent to forcing Rust's model to be losslessly transferable to a different programming language, say Zig. We can't assume that ideas about programming languages suddenly become applicable to all programming languages just because those ideas are published to a peer-reviewed journal. Our RFCs are always peer-reviewed, too.\nIt is cool to think about effects or capabilities and how we can encode them as modifiers to entities in the type system, be it traits, trait bounds, functions, impls, etc. We're not in the best place to unify them because const is the inverse of an effect (it prevents you from calling non-const items) while async is an actual effect (it allows you to call other async items). At the same time const seems like it wants to apply to the whole trait, while partial maybe-async traits seem very desirable.\nIf we wanted to unify them to make our version of effects closer to formal modeling, we must do so for everything that we currently have, not just const traits. So we should also think about whether it is really feasible to do so in the first place, and then decide whether or not we can proceed with a stabilization of const traits with the pieces that make the most sense for the language right now, without having to make our effects story consistent first.\nproposal 6: drowning in conditionals\nWe should have ~const fn and ~const trait and impl ~const, etc.\nThe idea here is that ~const is \"conditionally const\", i.e. may or may not require const impls depending on whether called from a const context. Given that const fn is also \"maybe-const\" (i.e. could be called from both non-const and const contexts), we should make them also use ~const, like ~const fn for consistency and also distinguish with const X: () = (); items.\nMy biggest feeling here is that it changes up everything for no gain. I think rarely anyone benefits from this. It might feel consistent but I'd rather not let us be consistent for consistent's sake.\nBut still, there are other consistency arguments that contradict this. const fn, const trait, and impl const, and const items/const blocks all restrict their bodies to operations performable in compile time, i.e. they must all call const fns. In terms of restriction they work mostly the same except for which trait's methods they can call (in const fn you can call methods from T: ~const Tr but in const items you can't)\nAlso, it makes little sense to have an \"always-const\" fn such that it cannot be called in non-const fns. But that's what ~const fn seems to imply exists.\nThe other idea here relates to the \"meaning of ~const\" section. The constness of the fn never changes. It should always be evaluatable at compile time. But when you pass in some T into const fn foo&lt;T: ~const Tr&gt; that doesn't impl const Tr, and try to call it from compile time, it's not that foo now is non-const (foo is fully prepared to be evaluated in compile time) but that you aren't satisfying foo's constraints.\nproposal 7: questionable conditions\n?const is okay for \"maybe-const\".. right?\nWe have received proposals like this because ~const introduces a new sigil, and the alternatives don't seem to be as good. Why don't we use T: ?const Trait to mean T: ~const Trait?\nThe main reason here is that ? has an existing meaning in trait-bound adjacent areas, which is to relax a bound, or to disable a default, such as ?Sized. T: ~const Trait is a stricter bound than T: Trait, so using ? for it isn't really nice. This is also the reason proposal 1 (and the ancient implementation before it got switched due to issues aforementioned) uses ?const for opt-out.\nUsing ?const for opt-in, on the other hand, isn't a good syntax proposal.\nlet's try picking wavelengths for these sheds..\nThese are things we should actually try to form consensus on before stabilizing:\n\nSyntax of the const-when-const bounds. There's ~const and [const] and (const)\n\nWe can figure this out along with possibility of proposal 3 (~const =&gt; const, const =&gt; =const or other) on the table.\n\n\nOrder of keywords - whether to use const impl Trait for Ty or impl const Trait for Ty\n\nHad some discussion on the RFC PR recently.\n\n\nNaming of Destruct\n\nNot really discussed anywhere, but we might want to find a better name for Destruct if we want to stabilize it. Droppable? Destroy?\n\n\n\nSave this for the future\nThese are some features that are not essential for const traits. Including them will unnecessarily enlarge the scope\nof the RFC. But it might still be useful to propose them later.\n\nconst fn trait methods - where downstream has to implement as const fn no matter whether impl is const or not.\n~const fn pointers, dyn ~const Trait, impl ~const Trait\nFiguring out something for the \"really const\" distinction (related to proposal 6), if that is really worth it - what\nwe should do with const {} blocks and const X: Ty = ... items.\nFiguring out a way to configure derives (built-in or custom) to generate const implementations.\n\nAlthough we might still want to recommend a way for custom derives to start generating const impls.\n\n\n\nSo, what's next?\nI started my work on const traits on July 1st, 2021, making it so that\nconst trait impls can be called across different crates. I've worked on the implementation of this feature since then,\nand now it's been four years.\nWe might still have many years to go, but hopefully this post helps making the language design discourse better.\nIf you would like to get involved, feel free to go comment on the open RFC (please comment on specific lines or on\nthe file using the PR review feature, this makes discussion threaded and much easier to follow), or follow discussions\noccuring on the #t-lang/effects Zulip channel.\nI suppose you can also consider supporting me on GitHub Sponsors :D\nAcknowledgements\n\nThanks errs for the encouragement to write this post, and oli for commenting on initial drafts of the proposal and providing more thinking on Proposal 4 and 4.5.\n\n","id":"https://dbeef.dev/const-trait-counterexamples/","title":"Const Trait Counterexamples"},"https://dbeef.dev/devlog001/":{"body":"I've been thinking of starting a devlog for a long time. There are many reasons why I couldn't just start it previously:\n\nLack of time. Do I really have time to do this stuff? Maybe I do, but am I going to spend too much time trying to get everything to look good and exactly as I wanted it on first try? Historically, that answer has been yes. A few days ago, I realized that that's not good, so instead of spending time on the looks I am just going to write some stuff.\nPerfectionism. Old me wanted a perfectly built place that matched what I wanted, but I have changed. Now I just want a place to write some ideas and updates.\nFocus. I mean, blog posts that actually get read by other people have a clear focus in what they want to write about, and I usually don't. Do I really need that for a blog? Not really.\n\nHopefully, by the time someone reads the above three points, they will also know that I ramble about things that don't really interest them. I guess that's fine, though, since maybe this can be a place where I write for myself and not for others. This is my first post ever, so there's time and space to explore things!\nOkay here's some exciting technical stuff:\nWorking with effects in Rust\nIn the Rust compiler, we're working on an initiative to make an internal refactoring while not changing the user-facing aspects of a feature named const_trait_impl. The old implementation simply made the feature a special case, treating it in many different ways in many different places, and had many issues that I won't go into in this dev log. (maybe for a separate blog post though!) But here are some progress and challenges recently:\nRenabling effects in core\nAs a step towards a more mature feature, we previously enabled effects in core, which made const fn and methods desugar into generic, depending on whether the function is called from a const context, like so:\n\nHere, the host flag is set to false if the function is called in compile time, while it is set to true if called from a context that runs in runtime. This desugaring shouldn't have any effects on anyone using the standard library or anything within the standard library. But we disabled effects after finding out that actually, you can just call a::&lt;true&gt;() when this desugaring is enabled, breaking the assumption that this feature is invisible to users. This was fixed shortly later, while a similar fallout that caused rustdoc to display these desugared parameters in the generated documentation was fixed in two PRs by oli-obk and fmease. After these fixes were merged, I went ahead and reenabled effects.\nEffects desugaring with default type params\nThe PartialEq trait is defined like this:\n\nAnd if we had the effects desugaring, it would be:\n\nAnd here we have a problem, since if someone tried to implement const PartialEq, their impl could look like:\n\nBut this (currently) generates a mismatch error since a const param host is supplied to a type param Rhs! To fix this, I have two ideas in mind:\n\nGive the desugaring of impl const and : ~const bounds special treatment, such that the parameters it desugar into must be dealt with specifically as opposed to the normal params supplied (this might involve changing the internal HIR representation of generic args)\nGive the params special treatment, but only use some sort of an internal marker to distinguish desugared host bounds. We'd change the logic somewhere when handling those params and fit the desugared param into its place correctly.\n\nI'll say they're quite similar and we might have to end up doing both. We'll see!\nChecking all method calls for effects\nSomewhere in the code for Rust's type checker, there's a function that enforces effects. This means that we try to equate effects to what we expect them to be. Here's an example to illustrate:\n\nBefore typeck (the process that we call type-checking), effect parameters are unknown (marked with a question mark), and the enforce_context_effects comes in and fills them in. These examples are all different:\n\nWhile trying to make PartialEq work as a const_trait, I noticed that method calls desugared by calling a == b don't get checked. This PR fixed that. Another step towards enabling effects by default for all crates!\nWhere are the other sections?\nI didn't have time so I'll end here. I do want to summarize the state of some personal projects that I have been working on for the past few years in a future devlog, but I also want to get this post done, so maybe in the next one!\n","id":"https://dbeef.dev/devlog001/","title":"Devlog 001"},"https://dbeef.dev/devlog002/":{"body":"Hi y'all! It's been a while since I've done a devlog, and I figured it's time to share a bunch of things\nI have worked on, just to celebrate what I've done and take some time to reflect on what I could do next.\nLet's get into it!\nRust related stuff\nConst Traits\nI've been working on this feature for almost four years now, and the\nfeature is only recently getting some momentum towards finally being accepted. Oli opened a new RFC which drew a lot\nof commentary and the lang team seems ready to accept, though only after we figure out how the syntax works. There's a\nlot of design work, which includes debating the syntax and finding reasons why one color for the shed works better than\nthe other, which is happening at the #t-lang/effects Zulip channel. I tried to articulate reasons for the colors I\nprefer, and I was moderately successful in convincing the lang team into adopting some of the choice.\nI'm actually hoping that const traits can get stabilized this year, given the amount of time and effort everyone is\nputting in to polish the language design into completion. I'm glad that I was able to help (even though errs did a\nreally fantastic job of figuring out the compiler architecture to make the thing robust and easy to develop) on the\ncompiler side to push things to a stable and well-tested state.\nFrontmatters\nThis was a particularly cool PR because I think I like working on the\ncompiler frontend. The backstory to that, though, was that I gave a lot of pedantic reviews in the original PR and made\nepage, the original author who drafted an implementation, quite annoyed at me. But at the same time, I wanted to\nensure that the compiler has a solid quality code to work off of, especially when it comes to initial implementations of\na feature. So I offered to implement it. It wasn't too bad because it wasn't my first time working on the lexer/parser\npart of the frontend, with my experience implementing c-str literals. Mapping out all the possible error cases and how\nbest to handle them did take some time though. It was a nice learning experience nonetheless.\nReviews\nI really like spending time to review PRs. At time of writing, I have 272 reviewed PRs that have been merged into\nrust-lang/rust. I'm also sometimes really nitpicky when it comes to reviews. I think it is good to point out things that\nthe other person may have not noticed instead of silently accepting, and it is also good to hear from different\nperspectives whether I am a reviewer or a PR author. I want to do more reviews and if I get bored I might steal some.\nAST visitor stuff\nI'm trying to deduplicate the AST Visitor and MutVisitor functions in rustc. The work is currently tracked at\n#127615, and it's mostly an exercise for me to get back at developing rustc in my free time. I've done some really\nclever stuff in the mean time:\nVisitor is allowed to return a ControlFlow while visiting stuff, this is controlled by the implementer's choice when\nimpling Visitor and setting the Result associated type to ControlFlow instead of the () by default.\nMutVisitor does not allow returning ControlFlows and only allows returning ()s. This creates some hassle while\nwriting the macro that emits functions for both visitors. My first solution to this is to use something like the\nfollowing:\n\nAlthough trivially copyable, it has a lot of characters and served as an extra step when converting from the normal\nV::Result. I then decided to use a sealed super trait trick in my latest PR:\n\nThen, we can use V::Result however we like, and it is a drop-in replacement because we know that it is always\ngoing to be (). Really proud of myself for this one.\nWikimedia related stuff\nWikiAuthBot-ng\nThis is a bot that uses OAuth to connect users on Discord to their\nidentity on Wikipedia. Some Wikipedia-related servers require people to authenticate to talk, while others want to use\nit to allow easy querying of identity from Discord.\nThe original version (WikiAuthBot) was written in Python and had a lot of bugs. I rewrote it in Rust and added a lot of\nadditional functionalities. Working with databases stood out particularly in my process in making this a completed,\nstable project. I first went with using the provided MariaDB instance on Toolforge, then I thought it was too slow and\nswitched to using Redis as a persistent storage. Then I thought it was too slow again and I tried SQLite. But Toolforge\nuses NFS for all hosted projects and SQLite is known to not work as optimally via NFS. I then went back to MariaDB and\nit got fast again. All of these involved writing small Rust code that translated data from one place to the other, which\nwas quite some hassle.\nIn the end though it worked out.\nDeadbeefBot\nThis was yet another project. It's tasks can be found on its\nWikipedia page, but it essentially helps maintain some formatting of Wikipedia pages. The code was not too hard and I\nworked on its design quite some time already, but it took some procrastinating for me to actually get this registered as\na cron job. But I got there in the end.\nw\nYeah, it's another MediaWiki API library. I originally wanted to use the name mw\nseeing that it wasn't used at the time, but it got taken by a different crate. I talked\nto the person who took that name and they refused to give it to me. Luckily the even shorter name w was available, so\nyay!\nw wants to be minimal because it doesn't want to make assumptions about how one should use it. My previous library was\na failure as I was too ambitious in wanting to represent all possible API combinations into types (turns out it's so\nhuge and messy, and in the end I would've only done the request part only anyways). So I decided to push that onto the\nusers. Users should decide how to serialize their requests and deserialize their responses.\nmwapi was a similar library, but my submissiveness to capitalism pushed me towards wanting a less restrictive\nlicense than GPL, and also because I can't easily work on multiple wiki instances at the same time. The latter feature\nwas really needed for WikiAuthBot-ng as it needs to work with Wikipedia servers in many different languages (so\ndifferent API instances).\nI hope I can polish it so that it is more ready for general use. I am satisfied about it enough to use it in my new\nprojects and I will add to it as I find missing features while using.\nScript syncing bot\nThis was my solution to a long-running problem on Wikipedia: How can user scripts\nbe deployed from GitHub to Wikipedia, as users try to load from the script hosted on Wikipedia? Yeah I know this might\nsound silly but many times it involved primitive copy-pasting locally to update the Wikipedia page.\nThis bot is still going through the community processes, but I'm hoping to deploy it soon :D\nLingering ideas\nOh I love some of these ideas.\nNon-GNU Linux from Scratch\nI've always wondered how you can make a Linux system from Scratch without using gcc or GNU libc. I used to love a lot of\nthese esoteric Linux software stuff. It's obviously possible: there are projects that have\nachieved this feat, but I have yet to see a nice tutorial on a step-by-step construction of this system, similar to the\nlegendary LFS book. I hope to write a blogpost when I find out about how myself.\nWASM based package managing\nThis is semi-related to the thing above. I've been using Nix for a long time and both the language and the package\nmanager are driving me a bit crazy. It's so burdensome to start a new package and/or write your own configuration,\nbecause there are so many different ways to achieve the same thing and there is no rigid way of how things get to be\nstructured.\nI want to fix that, and my Rusted brain wants me to make something in Rust. So I'm thinking of making package\ndescriptions from Rust files that will compile to WebAssembly, then get loaded by the package manager. I'm hoping to be\nable to use some of the free time that I have at the moment to try something out, after I had done a complete LFS\nwalkthrough and understood the process.\nRustfmt competitor\nI really want a replace for rustfmt because I had a suboptimal experience when trying to improve the codebase. A lot of\nthings are locked behind rustfmt's stability guarantee which forbids breaking changes to formatted code and forces new\nthings behind an edition gate. I don't like it because I don't think the codebase is solid enough for such a stability\nguarantee to work. More cleanups are necessary. I don't think Topiary will be good\nenough in a reasonable timeframe to compete with rustfmt (it might be a little too ambitious).\nMore investigation needed.\nSPI stuff\nOn Wikipedia there's this process called Sock puppet investigations that investigates whether someone has used multiple\naccounts to abuse. There are two things that I really want to work on, when I get time:\n\nCheckUsers have access to IP and additional data that helps determine whether two accounts are operated by the same\nperson. I want to improve the CheckUser interface because I think the current interface is not streamlined enough for\na smooth operation. This will start as a user script adding shortcuts, and I plan to gradually add more stuff to have\na more complete investigation experience.\nSPIs are really hard. Now that we have large language models, it might be really interesting to gather data from past\ncases and see which ones have resulted in blocks being placed and which ones have been declined. There are of course\nlevels to that, for example sometimes it might result in CheckUser being run and sometimes it won't. Having data and\nusing models to analyze this might give people who work at SPI a lot of insight as to what makes good SPI cases good\n(factoring in variables such as response times, what actions resulted from the report, basic data about the filer and\nthe users that have been filed against), and maybe it may also be useful to predict (for fun) the course of new SPI\ncases as they come in.\n\nWrapping Up\nI like writing and it is nice to document stuff that I'm doing. But I just do a lot of things and it is sometimes hard\nto fully summarize. I hope after this long post I can pick up and do more regular devlogs next.\nDid you like this post? Let me know :D\n","id":"https://dbeef.dev/devlog002/","title":"Devlog 002"},"https://dbeef.dev/linux-patch-fail/":{"body":"About half a year ago, I submitted my first patch to Linux. I initially thought the patch wasn't good, but I discovered something as I finished writing this blog post. Anyways, it was interesting to learn a very different system for submitting code to upstream.\nDiscovering the issue\nI got a brand new graphics card and I wanted to play with it. But Linux wouldn't let me. Some\nsearches led me to this issue where people have bisected the cause. So why don't we just revert the commit that caused it? I did that, tried\nrunning with the kernel with that commit reverted and the issue got fixed again.\nSo.. there's probably something wrong in that commit. Although I have no experience in writing graphics drivers in C, submitting the revert upstream should be easy..\nFollowing the guide\nOkay. Linux uses Git. Surely there's not much difference to contributing to a project on GitHub, right? Well, no. Let's do a brief walkthrough of the guide to submitting a patch to Linux:\n\nClone the code. See? It's the same as.. wait a second. Okay. There are many different trees other than the mainline tree and depending on where you send the patch to, you may want to choose the tree they're using.\nWrite the change. Well this part is the same as developing on any project, except you'd just be writing code for Linux instead.\nCommit. You'd need to add the relevant Closes: and the Signed-off-by: tags. Not too hard, but still different.\nSubmit the patch. As the last step, you have to send an email to the correct place that would review your patch. You'd either have to configure Git to authenticate to your email and send an email with git send-email, or configure your email client to send in plain-text your patch.\n\nWhat went wrong?\nWell.. I had no trouble producing a patch that could get sent upstream, in the end, it was just a simple revert. Even though there were some conflicts, editing the code for a revert was still quite easy. Sending the patch was a bit of nuisance, as I had to configure gmail to send in plain-text mode and copy the patch there, but still, there were no problems.\nThe problem was something in between. Unfamiliar with the patch format as I was, I got confused about indentation.\n\n.. Am I sure that the code in the +s of the patch are aligned with the rest of the code there?\nWouldn't that just have one less space when you apply the patch? Shouldn't the patched parts have\nan additional space compared to the rest?\nIn the midst of questioning myself and indentation of patches, I decided to add an extra space to all\nthe lines starting with a + in that patch. That resulted in this. Indentation looks out of place, all due to my poor formatting..\nHuh?\nOkay wait. I wanted to end my blogpost there. That was my original plan. I write about an indentation mistake I did when submitting a patch for Linux, for some reason they decided to accept it, but it was my fault, I would apologize for that and hope people understand the mistake as a first-time contributor. But the indentation looks perfectly fine in the reviewer's git repo.\nDid they fix it for me? Why did the diff on mainline Linux look like that then? Well I had a theory. The indentation in different trees were different, so when a patch based on the amd tree got sent to the mainline, the indentation did not match the code on the mainline tree. So it was not something caused by poor indentation on my side..1\nI had taken on guilt for poor indentation that I thought landed to the mainline. When the reviewer probably fixed it themselves, and the indentation problem I thought was caused by me was probably due to something else. And blogging about it was how I discovered the truth. Oh well.\nClosing\nSo that's my experience of sending a patch to the Linux kernel for the first time. Rust for Linux looks like it is being actively developed. If it actually goes to the mainstream, it might give me more opportunity to contribute to Linux with a language that I actually understand. Hopefully, this won't be the last patch I will submit to Linux!\n1\nWell that's what I think has happened. If anyone know what actually happened please let me know.\n\n","id":"https://dbeef.dev/linux-patch-fail/","title":"My First Patch to Linux"}},"docInfo":{"https://dbeef.dev/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://dbeef.dev/about/":{"body":28,"title":0},"https://dbeef.dev/const-trait-counterexamples/":{"body":2584,"title":3},"https://dbeef.dev/devlog001/":{"body":421,"title":2},"https://dbeef.dev/devlog002/":{"body":971,"title":2},"https://dbeef.dev/linux-patch-fail/":{"body":372,"title":3}},"length":6},"lang":"English"}
